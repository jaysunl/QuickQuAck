## Setting up Dependencies

In order to install all of the dependencies, go into the `QQLogin` folder and run `npm install`. Then, go into the `server` folder and run `npm install`, followed by `npm install dotenv`. This should allow you to run the app. If you receive errors at this point, it's most likely because a dependency did not get installed. Please either google the error or message others on slack to try and resolve it. Make sure to update everyone so if the problem arises again we know how to deal with it!
